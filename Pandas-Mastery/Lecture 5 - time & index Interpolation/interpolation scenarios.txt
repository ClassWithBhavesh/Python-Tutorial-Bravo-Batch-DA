# 💡 Scenario 1:
# Financial datasets often have missing closing prices for holidays or missing records due to feed issues.
# You must fill in prices to maintain a uniform time series for visualization or algorithmic trading.


# 💡 Scenario 2:
# A retail store’s POS system missed recording sales for some days.
# You need a continuous dataset to generate weekly trends.


# 💡 Scenario 3:
# A logistics company stores medicines that must remain between 2°C and 8°C.
# The IoT sensors log temperature every 30 minutes, but sometimes data packets are lost.
# We must reconstruct missing data using time-aware interpolation before sending alerts.


# 💡 Scenario 4:
# A weather scientist is analyzing air pressure with respect to altitude.
# Some readings are missing due to sensor failure at certain heights.
# We’ll interpolate based on altitude (numeric index) — not equal steps, but meaningful vertical distances.


# 💡 Scenario 5:
# A factory tracks efficiency (%) of its production line at different machine speeds.
# During a test, a few efficiency readings were missed.
# We use machine speed (index) to interpolate missing efficiencies accurately.
